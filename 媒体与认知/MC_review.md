PPT1  Expand cognitive ability

**TOF：**

* Low Light Performance: unaffected by ambient（周围） light variations, performs 

well in low light conditions

* Speed: direct distance measurements, no deciphered or interpreted

**Structured light:** 

* Temporal（时间） scan instead of Spatial point scan

* More accurate and fast in**short range**; Not for long range / complex illumination

**active light**

* to measure the hidden object:
* Grid search on the visible wall；  Collect the pattern of multiple scattering light
